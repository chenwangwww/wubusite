<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always; text-align: center;"><div><p style="font-weight: 600;">WUBU FZCO | RISK DISCLOSURES | JULY 2024</p>

</div></div>

By engaging with our Services, you recognize and agree to the risks described in thisStatement and any other risks linked to trading virtual assets.

<p style="font-weight: 600;">2. MARKET AND LIQUIDITY RISKS</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>a) Market condition risks: The valuation of virtual assets which are bought or sold by you maybe influenced by market conditions, which may be either favourable or adverse. This meansthat the value of a virtual asset may fluctuate and may lose their value in full or in part.</p>
<p>b) Divestment concerns: In some scenarios, virtual assets may pose challenges duringdivestment. For instance, some might lack liquidity, making them tough to sell, or might fetcha price lower than the acquisition cost when you aim to divest.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600;">3. DEFAULT AND CONTRACT TERMINATION</p>
<p>Upon opening an account with us, should any default event transpire, or should any act oromission by you result in an actual or potential breach of the Client Agreement, we reserve theright to close, terminate, suspend or modify any transaction or your account in accordance withthe Client Agreement. Any charges or pending payments from you, will be adjusted inaccordance with the Agreement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600;">4. RISKS RELATED TO VIRTUAL ASSETS</p>
<p>a) Virtual assets are not legal tenders: Virtual assets, often termed cryptocurrencies, digitalassets, or digital currencies, are not considered official currencies (i.e. legal tender) in mostjurisdictions. Their value isn&#8217;t backed by central banks or governments, leading to potentialnon-recognition and non-acceptance in various situations.</p>
<p>b) Market risk and volatility: The value of virtual assets are influenced by broad marketmovements, external events and global economic changes, resulting in potential losses.Engaging in virtual asset trading exposes users to profound market risks, underpinned byerratic price volatility. The volatility in this space is so significant that valuations can shiftdramatically, and often suddenly, without any preceding indicators. Historical performancecharts are not reliable yardsticks for forecasting future trends. Given the unpredictable natureholding onto virtual assets demands vigilance. You should be cautious about holding virtualassets and are warned that you should pay close attention to your position and holdings, andhow you may be impacted by sudden and adverse shifts in trading and other marketactivities. Investment in virtual assets could result in losses in parts or even entirety ofinvestment. You should not invest funds that you are not prepared to lose in their entirety.Further the price of virtual assets on one platform might differ considerably from anotherplatform due to liquidity variances. While we make reasonable efforts to establish reliablepricing policies and practices, there can be unforeseen impacts on virtual asset valuesaffecting the prices of our Services. You acknowledge and understand that we can&#8217;tguarantee that our provided price for any virtual asset or Services will always be better thanprices on other broker-Dealers or platforms.</p>
<p>c) Irreversible transactions and limited legal recourse: Given the decentralized nature of virtualasset transactions, once executed, transactions cannot be reversed. To the extent that any ofyour virtual assets are incorrectly or fraudulently transferred, they are likely to beirretrievable. Furthermore, where virtual assets have been lost, stolen or destroyed under</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>circumstances rendering a party liable to you, then you may have limited recourse against theresponsible party.</p>
<p>d) Transferability of virtual assets: There may be circumstances wherein you may not be able totransfer your virtual assets to external virtual asset wallets. These circumstances amongstothers include,; exceeding virtual asset transfer limits established for your account inaccordance with our internal risk and anti-money laundering processes and policies; flaggingof destination wallet addresses as tainted/suspicious wallet addresses; system maintenance;suspensions of trading/withdrawals in particular virtual assets required under applicable lawby regulatory authorities or to protect the fair and orderly operation of the market; and otherevents out of our control.</p>
<p>e) Delays in transactions and transfers: Transfer times for virtual assets can vary due to networkcongestion, technological issues, or other unforeseen delays. Further, virtual asset transfersare subjected to screening processes in line with the applicable regulatory standards andlegislation. Certain patterns and sizes of transactions could be subject to enhanced scrutinywhich could result in delays or rejection of the transfer request. This may impact your abilityto transfer virtual assets in your account.</p>
<p>f) Liquidity risk: Selling virtual assets quickly without affecting their market price becomeschallenging, especially in less liquid markets or during market disruptions. Thin investmentmarkets can amplify volatility and heightened responsiveness to buying and selling pressurescompared to more actively traded markets. Such illiquidity could potentially affect the abilityto place orders, thus, potentially resulting in losses or delays in accessing funds.</p>
<p>g) Liquidity slippage risk: While we make efforts to monitor and maintain liquidity of virtualassets in relation to which we provide Services, market conditions might create a lack ofliquidity and devaluate the asset or cause a strong slippage on price when executing an order.You acknowledge and understand that price fluctuation occurring after you place an ordercan affect its execution price. Further, you acknowledge that limit orders will only beexecuted when the requested price is achieved rather than the published price. This meansthat there is a possibility that a limit order is only executed partially (or in certain extremesituations the order is not executed at all).</p>
<p>h) Public record of transactions: Transactions involving virtual assets are recorded on publicledgers, which, while not directly linking identities, can lead to potential privacy concerns. Inthe past, flaws in the source code for virtual asset networks have exposed users&#8217; personalinformation.</p>
<p>i) Market manipulation and fraud risk: The virtual asset market, is susceptible to manipulativepractices and fraudulent schemes, which can distort prices and market integrity. The marketis subject to an increased risk of fraud, including the potential for amongst others, bucketshops, ponzi schemes and pump and dump schemes. Such targeted schemes may result in theunrecoverable loss of virtual assets or a loss of part or all of your virtual assets, and you maynot benefit from legal protections.</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>j) Increased cyber-attack risk: Virtual asset platforms and wallets are enticing targets forhackers. Virtual assets, by their inherent nature, are especially susceptible to cyber threats.The digital space in which they operate makes them prime targets for various malevolentactivities. Hackers and fraudulent entities often set their sights on these assets, orchestratingsophisticated attacks. These can include inter-alia:</p>
<p>a. Distributed Denial of Service (&#8220;DDoS&#8221;): Overwhelming services by flooding themwith information requests;</p>
<p>b. Sybil attacks: A malicious actor takes over multiple nodes in a network, essentiallygaining undue influence;</p>
<p>c. Phishing: Deceptive attempts to gather sensitive data by impersonating trustworthyentities;</p>
<p>d. Social engineering: Manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information;e. Hacking: Unauthorized intrusion into systems or networks;f. Smurfing: Flooding networks with traffic by spoofing an IP address;g. Malware: Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt or gain unauthorized</p>
<p>access;h. Majority-mining, consensus-based or other mining attacks: Exploiting the consensus</p>
<p>mechanism of blockchain networks to gain control; andi. Spoofing: Disguising communication from an unknown source as coming from a</p>
<p>trusted one.The decentralized and digital structure of virtual assets and the underlying distributed ledgertechnology amplifies the potential risks associated with cyber threats. If these attacks aresuccessful, they could lead to significant losses, including the potential complete loss of yourvirtual assets. Moreover, legal protections may not apply to such targeted malicious acts.</p>
<p>k) Account security risk: Failure to use robust security practices can render your accountsvulnerable. This includes risks from phishing, malware, and other malicious activities.Unauthorised access may be gained by third parties of your login credentials to gain accessto your account, including through carelessness or forgetfulness by the account holder, or thethird-party obtaining control over another device or account used by you in connection withany enhanced security measures enabled for your account. It is not possible to eliminate allsecurity risks. You acknowledge and accept that you are responsible for keeping youraccount and log-in details safe, and you may be responsible for all the transactions conductedthrough your account, whether authorised by you or not.</p>
<p>l) Legal risk: The regulatory framework for virtual assets is evolving and can change withoutnotice. Changes in laws and regulations by VARA and/or any relevant regulatory authoritymay materially affect the value, and use of virtual assets.</p>
<p>m) Enforcement action: Regulatory bodies may take action against virtual asset platforms orusers, leading to potential disruptions, losses, or legal consequences. In circumstances wherethere are regulatory interventions, changes to the legal landscape, or situations making ouroperations untenable or financially unviable in a particular jurisdiction, we may decide tohalt our Services. This may result in you losing access to your account and may further resultin the loss of any virtual assets stored or held on your account.</p>
